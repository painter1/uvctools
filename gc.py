# Simple garbage collector for replicated CMIP5 data.
# This moves data to another directory.  Deletion should not happen until someone
# has looked over the purportedly obsolete data.

# >>>> TO DO, and this is important: check version numbers, and a file is bad
# >>>> if we have a more recent version.

# This script requires data to be organized as unpublished data usually is organized on CSS
# at PCMDI.
# That is, <anything>/scratch/<abs_path>/version/variable/file.nc and
# sometimes bad-checksum files in  <anything>/scratch/<abs_path>/version/variable/bad?/file.nc.
# I plan to generalize this as necessary, but no more.

# This could be implemented either by moving bad data or by moving good data.
# There's not a big difference in performance or coding between the two.
## I originally decided to do it by moving good data because there is a kind of status propagation
## which I thought may turn out to be easier to implement this way.  If anything in a dataset is
## "good", i.e. in the database, then probably everything else in the dataset should be made good,
## i.e. added to the dataset (But rarely a file may have been withdrawn without updating the
## dataset's version number.)
## It turned out that this aspect of it was equally easy either way.
# Nevertheless, "moving good data" is superior for two reasons.
# 1. Most important, the "maybe bad" files are out of the regular dirctory hierarchy,
# where we can look at them without interfering with normal operations.
# 2. It makes it simple to reject files which are in the wrong place, i.e. a directory which
# should have no files.
#
# Thus the first step is to move all the data to another directory.
# Then move it back if it's "good", which means that it's in the database, and the database
# says that we have it (even if incomplete or corrupted).
# Also move anything in the same dataset as a "good" file, but if it's not in the database
# we should remember that problem.
# In the process we will build lists describing the "possibly bad" files.  Some kinds of
# "possibly bad" will suggest that the database needs an update, others that the file
# should be deleted.
# Note that any file in an unexpected location will be "possibly bad".
